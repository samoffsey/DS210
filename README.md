## Purpose
In a large company, it can be difficult to design an organizational structure that effectively represents the way employees collaborate and communicate. Organizational network analysis aims to use graph network analysis to create better teams. In this project, I will use rust to calculate centrality metrics in order to determine which employees are most central to the organization and whether the existing company structure reflects these interactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was provided by Harvard Dataverse. The graph dataset represents approximately 83,000 email communications sent between 167 accounts for a manufacturing company over a 9 month period. The csv file “communication.csv” represents this graph as a list of directional edges. The csv file “reportsto.csv” contains the official organization structure as a list of directional edges.
